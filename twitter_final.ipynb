      "|!!!!??? (sorry couldn't explain what I'm feeling other than by using words that might not be very appropriate for a public website) :)Not only could I just not put down the book, but I was totally exhausted from all the actions and emotions ! There isn't a single boring page, and the mix of fright, worry, sadness (I am SO missing Pete), horror and the frantic pace of the story really made reading this book an awesome experience.One thing is sure, I never ever want to be in Lorne's shoes lol !A recommended read. I liked Cruel Justice. This one is definitely as good.

      "|\"'Looking Through Lace\" 'is the story of Toni, a xenolinguist who is assigned to work with a first contact team. She's been relegated to doing grunt work until now, and is really excited for the opportunity to prove herself.The alien world in '\"Looking Through Lace\" 'is fascinating - although the inhabitants are descended from humans, they have a unique history and culture. The women speak an entirely different language among themselves that the men are not allowed to learn, and Toni is determined to figure out how and why that happened. However, she has a jealous senior colleague and the affections of an attractive native (who just happens to be in a group marriage) to contend with.I enjoyed reading a science-fiction story by Nestvold; all the other work I've read by her has been fantasy. She keeps up the excellent worldbuilding and characters. I found the revelations concerning the history of the world very interesting. The antagonist xenolinguist seemed like a bit of a caricature, but the interesting alien world more than made up for it.

      "|\"*69\" starts with an interesting concept: what if someone's cell phone inadvertently called you while that person was committing a murder? Pretty creepy, especially if you've ever gotten one of those odd calls where there's no one on the other line, but you can hear something like breathing or some kind of commotion. In Blake's story, after the initial phone call, there's a quaintness to the married couple pondering who might have called and whether they actually overheard someone's murder. But the story quickly ramps up as their suspicions escalate and their actions to learn the truth cross a couple of lines. A really strong opener for this collection.\"Remaking\" is a tragic bit of work strikes a nerve considering the number of times you hear about a child abduction on the six-o-clock news. If I had to pick a runt from this litter of stories, \"Remaking\" would be it, but it's still one that kept me hooked until the end because the man's torment and how it threatened the safety of the child was chilling.\"On the Good, Red Road\" is a western that acts as a prelude of sorts to a novel of Blake's called Abandon. A man tries to make his way to a mining town, but winds up in the couple of a trio of outlaws. Things are tense enough as the guy tries to gauge how best to get away from the villains, but when a sudden blizzard leaves them stranded and starving in the middle of nowhere, that's when it really turns into a nail-biter.\"Shining Rock\" struck me as a story with a really strong start and finish, but there was a piece in the middle that strained my credulity. A married couple are on a romantic excursion in the bucolic fields of a park called Shining Rock, and are approached by a lone man from a neighboring campsite who at first seems off-putting with his large knife, but ultimately charms them with smalltalk and pricey booze. But there's something about the lone man and his brief tale of tragedy during drunken chatter that sets the husband on edge and has him wanting to flee the park as soon as possible. I really liked the story overall, but there was one aspect of the wife's reaction to her husband's revelation that didn't feel believable to me. Aside from that, it was probably my favorite story of the four.It's a nice hodgepodge for anyone who'd care to check out Blake's work for the first time. A little bit of everything, from western to psychological thriller, to horror. There's a larger collection on the Kindle Store called Fully Loaded, which includes these four stories and a bunch more (his collaboration with J.A. Konrath, Serial, among them), so I'll have to check that out sometime, too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |[69, starts, with, an, interesting, concept, what, if, someone, s, cell, phone, inadvertently, called, you, while, that, person, was, committing, a, murder, pretty, creepy, especially, if, you, ve, ever, gotten, one, of, those, odd, calls, where, there, s, no, one, on, the, other, line, but, you, can, hear, something, like, breathing, or, some, kind, of, commotion, in, blake, s, story, after, the, initial, phone, call, there, s, a, quaintness, to, the, married, couple, pondering, who, might, have, called, and, whether, they, actually, overheard, someone, s, murder, but, the, story, quickly, ramps, up, as, their, suspicions, escalate, and, their, actions, to, learn, the, truth, cross, a, couple, of, lines, a, really, strong, opener, for, this, collection, remaking, is, a, tragic, bit, of, work, strikes, a, nerve, considering, the, number, of, times, you, hear, about, a, child, abduction, on, the, six, o, clock, news, if, i, had, to, pick, a, runt, from, this, litter, of, stories, remaking, would, be, it, but, it, s, still, one, that, kept, me, hooked, until, the, end, because, the, man, s, torment, and, how, it, threatened, the, safety, of, the, child, was, chilling, on, the, good, red, road, is, a, western, that, acts, as, a, prelude, of, sorts, to, a, novel, of, blake, s, called, abandon, a, man, tries, to, make, his, way, to, a, mining, town, but, winds, up, in, the, couple, of, a, trio, of, outlaws, things, are, tense, enough, as, the, guy, tries, to, gauge, how, best, to, get, away, from, the, villains, but, when, a, sudden, blizzard, leaves, them, stranded, and, starving, in, the, middle, of, nowhere, that, s, when, it, really, turns, into, a, nail, biter, shining, rock, struck, me, as, a, story, with, a, really, strong, start, and, finish, but, there, was, a, piece, in, the, middle, that, strained, my, credulity, a, married, couple, are, on, a, romantic, excursion, in, the, bucolic, fields, of, a, park, called, shining, rock, and, are, approached, by, a, lone, man, from, a, neighboring, campsite, who, at, first, seems, off, putting, with, his, large, knife, but, ultimately, charms, them, with, smalltalk, and, pricey, booze, but, there, s, something, about, the, lone, man, and, his, brief, tale, of, tragedy, during, drunken, chatter, that, sets, the, husband, on, edge, and, has, him, wanting, to, flee, the, park, as, soon, as, possible, i, really, liked, the, story, overall, but, there, was, one, aspect, of, the, wife, s, reaction, to, her, husband, s, revelation, that, didn, t, feel, believable, to, me, aside, from, that, it, was, probably, my, favorite, story, of, the, four, it, s, a, nice, hodgepodge, for, anyone, who, d, care, to, check, out, blake, s, work, for, the, first, time, a, little, bit, of, everything, from, western, to, psychological, thriller, to, horror, there, s, a, larger, collection, on, the, kindle, store, called, fully, loaded, which, includes, these, four, stories, and, a, bunch, more, his, collaboration, with, j, a, konrath, serial, among, them, so, i, ll, have, to, check, that, out, sometime, too]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |495   |\n",
      "|\"... Couldn't you at least sin a little? You're supposed to be a princess of Hell.\"And with that we meet Lucifer.  Satan.  The One and Only.  The Big Bad.  And let me tell you, he is awesome.  And in this story Satan is a dad.  And he is funny and snarky and quick-witted, just like his daughter, Muriel.  Sure, he's still got a job to do running Hell and all, but he also has a 23 year old daughter to look after, and she is a hand full!Meet Muriel. She still holds her V-card, but she owns a bar.  She wants to make it on her own, and she wants to make it with a man (but don't tell her dad, he'd be elated!)  Ok, so those are two different versions of \"make it\" but who is counting? So when Mr. Gorgeous and Full of Hotness himself walks into her bar, she's left breathing a little heavy.Let's meet Auric. Everything about him is best left for you to find out.  But I will tell you he is hot, scarred, and he makes me wish I was Satan's daughter too.I loved this story!  It had everything that I look for.  Funny and smart woman?  Check.  Super-freakin-hot man? Check.  Danger and intrigue? Check.  Impossible situations, secrets and intense heat? Check check check! In a great style I have quickly come to associate with all things Eve Langlais, Lucifer's Daughter knocks this one right out of the park.  And Muriel has a rocking fashion sense on top of it all.  Demons, hellhounds, succubi, shifters, angels, and more.I found Auric to be a formidable match for Muriel.  I love him.  From his very beginning gruffness, to an unusual display of love set to music (ahem, which was all too perfect after Googling to get the scoop for myself), to his alpha personality and bottomless love for Muriel.  And he has a scar.  Scars are definitely sexy, maybe even more so than tattoos! Auric doesn't show all of his cards at once, he slowly lets out his wonderfulness.  And I'm hooked.  I want to read a hundred books all set around this green eyed, raven haired beauty of a man.Muriel is perfectly written.  She is a tough girl, and she is smart.  She wants to be independent, but she is still her father's daughter.  She has weapons and power, and great style.  Her family (which is sizable) loves her.  She lit up the pages with her wit and attitude.  Her past has secrets that I can't wait to get the answers to - like who is her mother??I loved this book that I went right to Amazon and purchased the next in the series, Snowballs in Hell.  So stay close for a review of that in the upcoming weeks, and also the Freakn' Shifters series which I have coming up too!Ok, one more quote from Lucifer's Daughter:\"You're making me look like a bad parent.  My minions in Hell are laughing at me.  There have even been rumors I'm no longer fir to be the Father Of All Sin, since I can't even control my own daughter.\"Love it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |[couldn, t, you, at, least, sin, a, little, you, re, supposed, to, be, a, princess, of, hell, and, with, that, we, meet, lucifer, satan, the, one, and, only, the, big, bad, and, let, me, tell, you, he, is, awesome, and, in, this, story, satan, is, a, dad, and, he, is, funny, and, snarky, and, quick, witted, just, like, his, daughter, muriel, sure, he, s, still, got, a, job, to, do, running, hell, and, all, but, he, also, has, a, 23, year, old, daughter, to, look, after, and, she, is, a, hand, full, meet, muriel, she, still, holds, her, v, card, but, she, owns, a, bar, she, wants, to, make, it, on, her, own, and, she, wants, to, make, it, with, a, man, but, don, t, tell, her, dad, he, d, be, elated, ok, so, those, are, two, different, versions, of, make, it, but, who, is, counting, so, when, mr, gorgeous, and, full, of, hotness, himself, walks, into, her, bar, she, s, left, breathing, a, little, heavy, let, s, meet, auric, everything, about, him, is, best, left, for, you, to, find, out, but, i, will, tell, you, he, is, hot, scarred, and, he, makes, me, wish, i, was, satan, s, daughter, too, i, loved, this, story, it, had, everything, that, i, look, for, funny, and, smart, woman, check, super, freakin, hot, man, check, danger, and, intrigue, check, impossible, situations, secrets, and, intense, heat, check, check, check, in, a, great, style, i, have, quickly, come, to, associate, with, all, things, eve, langlais, lucifer, s, daughter, knocks, this, one, right, out, of, the, park, and, muriel, has, a, rocking, fashion, sense, on, top, of, it, all, demons, hellhounds, succubi, shifters, angels, and, more, i, found, auric, to, be, a, formidable, match, for, muriel, i, love, him, from, his, very, beginning, gruffness, to, an, unusual, display, of, love, set, to, music, ahem, which, was, all, too, perfect, after, googling, to, get, the, scoop, for, myself, to, his, alpha, personality, and, bottomless, love, for, muriel, and, he, has, a, scar, scars, are, definitely, sexy, maybe, even, more, so, than, tattoos, auric, doesn, t, show, all, of, his, cards, at, once, he, slowly, lets, out, his, wonderfulness, and, i, m, hooked, i, want, to, read, a, hundred, books, all, set, around, this, green, eyed, raven, haired, beauty, of, a, man, muriel, is, perfectly, written, she, is, a, tough, girl, and, she, is, smart, she, wants, to, be, independent, but, she, is, still, her, father, s, daughter, she, has, weapons, and, power, and, great, style, her, family, which, is, sizable, loves, her, she, lit, up, the, pages, with, her, wit, and, attitude, her, past, has, secrets, that, i, can, t, wait, to, get, the, answers, to, like, who, is, her, mother, i, loved, this, book, that, i, went, right, to, amazon, and, purchased, the, next, in, the, series, snowballs, in, hell, so, stay, close, for, a, review, of, that, in, the, upcoming, weeks, and, also, the, freakn, shifters, series, which, i, have, coming, up, too, ok, one, more, quote, from, lucifer, s, daughter, you, re, making, me, look, like, a, bad, parent, my, minions, in, hell, are, laughing, at, me, there, have, even, been, rumors, i, m, no, longer, fir, to, be, the, father, of, all, sin, since, i, can, t, even, control, my, own, daughter, love, it]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |551   |\n",

She draws one right into the story line right along with her characters.

      "|\"A Hard Man is Good to Find\" takes match-making to a new extreme.  Knowing that her two closest friends were perfect for one another - if they would stop hating each other long enough to figure it out - Callie left her house to both of them under the condition that they live in it together for one year.  After the year was up, they could either sell it and split the proceeds or, as she had hoped, live there together having \"wild monkey sex in every room of the house at least once a day.\"  Kelsey and Clint had not expected this to say the least when they attended the reading of the will of their recently departed very close friend.Kelsey is an independent woman who becomes enraged just about every time she is near Clint Duncan, although she is not oblivious to the fact that her nipples are almost always erect in his presence as well.  She is simultaneously infuriated and completely turned on by him.  Clint's reaction to Kelsey, both physically and emotionally, is pretty much the same.  The reader is treated to a perhaps predictable tale where the two protagonists slowly begin to overlook their irritation and expose their infatuation for one another.One thing that I really liked about this book is that from the beginning, it was no secret that Kelsey is in fact a spankophile.  She references spanking in the first few pages and quickly delves into a spanky daydream featuring her nemesis, Clint, himself.I like the majority of Carolyn Faulkner's spanking fiction.  She writes very well and draws the reader in.  Her books seem to follow the typical romance novel template: ordinary woman meets tall hunk and initially HATES him - but eventually starts to see his finer qualities.  They eventually have a whirl wind romance and declare complete and total devotion to one another.  The only difference is that Carolyn's template includes a session over the knee of the tall hunk every chapter or so (which I have to say is a great twist on the typical romance novel).  I am a huge fan of Carolyn Faulkner as I love occasionally getting lost in a tale of love and spanking.  If you are looking to spend an afternoon like this, then I would definitely recommend you pick up a copy of \"A Hard Man is Good to Find.\"Katerina of BottomsUpBookReview                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |[a, hard, man, is, good, to, find, takes, match, making, to, a, new, extreme, knowing, that, her, two, closest, friends, were, perfect, for, one, another, if, they, would, stop, hating, each, other, long, enough, to, figure, it, out, callie, left, her, house, to, both, of, them, under, the, condition, that, they, live, in, it, together, for, one, year, after, the, year, was, up, they, could, either, sell, it, and, split, the, proceeds, or, as, she, had, hoped, live, there, together, having, wild, monkey, sex, in, every, room, of, the, house, at, least, once, a, day, kelsey, and, clint, had, not, expected, this, to, say, the, least, when, they, attended, the, reading, of, the, will, of, their, recently, departed, very, close, friend, kelsey, is, an, independent, woman, who, becomes, enraged, just, about, every, time, she, is, near, clint, duncan, although, she, is, not, oblivious, to, the, fact, that, her, nipples, are, almost, always, erect, in, his, presence, as, well, she, is, simultaneously, infuriated, and, completely, turned, on, by, him, clint, s, reaction, to, kelsey, both, physically, and, emotionally, is, pretty, much, the, same, the, reader, is, treated, to, a, perhaps, predictable, tale, where, the, two, protagonists, slowly, begin, to, overlook, their, irritation, and, expose, their, infatuation, for, one, another, one, thing, that, i, really, liked, about, this, book, is, that, from, the, beginning, it, was, no, secret, that, kelsey, is, in, fact, a, spankophile, she, references, spanking, in, the, first, few, pages, and, quickly, delves, into, a, spanky, daydream, featuring, her, nemesis, clint, himself, i, like, the, majority, of, carolyn, faulkner, s, spanking, fiction, she, writes, very, well, and, draws, the, reader, in, her, books, seem, to, follow, the, typical, romance, novel, template, ordinary, woman, meets, tall, hunk, and, initially, hates, him, but, eventually, starts, to, see, his, finer, qualities, they, eventually, have, a, whirl, wind, romance, and, declare, complete, and, total, devotion, to, one, another, the, only, difference, is, that, carolyn, s, template, includes, a, session, over, the, knee, of, the, tall, hunk, every, chapter, or, so, which, i, have, to, say, is, a, great, twist, on, the, typical, romance, novel, i, am, a, huge, fan, of, carolyn, faulkner, as, i, love, occasionally, getting, lost, in, a, tale, of, love, and, spanking, if, you, are, looking, to, spend, an, afternoon, like, this, then, i, would, definitely, recommend, you, pick, up, a, copy, of, a, hard, man, is, good, to, find, katerina, of, bottomsupbookreview]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |403   |\n",
      "|\"A Hero for Jessica\" is well written. The short story format lends itself expertly to Kindle users. Mrs. Thibodeaux introduces readers to Paul, a successful, handsome, and reluctant to fall in love attorney. Jessica needs to find an attorney to help her with some frightening and frustrating personal problems. She is a successful author. Paul and Jessica discover they not only love each other, but they are perfect heroes. Jessica finds her hero. Paul finds his heroine.I have read almost all of Pamela Thibodeaux's short stories and novels. She is an excellent author. She takes readers on journeys without losing sight of God.

      "|\"A Secret in the Attic\" byA very intriguing and engaging story about a magic spell set by a jealous friend of the family decades ago to ruin the lives of future generations of women in this family wanting to marry the loves of their lives.  Oh, they can marry, but the consequences are not what they desire.Amy's Grandmother had just given her the bookstore and coffee shop she owned for her twenty-first birthday.  Her Grandmother,  now retired, sets off to travel with a friend.  Amy, now the owner, is left to run both shops.One day a very handsome man walks into the shop.  Even though Amy is engaged, she becomes friends with this man and falls passionately in love with him, and he, with her.They decide to marry, that is, until one day when Amy finds a book in the attic with both her and her fianc&eacute;s names written in it.  Just what was this book?  There were other women's names from the family written in it whom she recognizes as she reads the rest of it.  There is more.  It also has some sort of spell stating that whoever's name appears in this book is `Subject to the curse of the Widowed Bride'?  What is this?  Is this a curse?  Is this a joke?  Who did this?  Who got in this attic and wrote her name in this book?It's time to call Grandma.  Amy needs help and fast.This was a very good book.  The author wrote this in a very engaging way.  The plot was laid out very well and the characters were well developed.  This story keeps your interest because once you start reading this story, you are not going to stop.  You can't.  You have to know how this turns out.Even though the description of the story is written above, it is very sketchy and there are no spoilers.  There is so much more to this story that it will surprise you.  It is well worth your time to read this enjoyable book.I won this Ebook as a Giveaway from the Freedom Hop Giveaway we just had, from the Publisher, Livingston Hall Publishers.  This is the first Urban Fantasy I have ever read.  I enjoyed it very much.  I will have to stretch further and read more of these.As a matter of fact, in the back of the book, the author has included the first two chapters of another book she has written, called \"The Apothecary\".  Well, I already went to Amazon and downloaded the Ebook!  Check it out.  Both books are only 99 cents.Laurie Carlson                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |[a, secret, in, the, attic, bya, very, intriguing, and, engaging, story, about, a, magic, spell, set, by, a, jealous, friend, of, the, family, decades, ago, to, ruin, the, lives, of, future, generations, of, women, in, this, family, wanting, to, marry, the, loves, of, their, lives, oh, they, can, marry, but, the, consequences, are, not, what, they, desire, amy, s, grandmother, had, just, given, her, the, bookstore, and, coffee, shop, she, owned, for, her, twenty, first, birthday, her, grandmother, now, retired, sets, off, to, travel, with, a, friend, amy, now, the, owner, is, left, to, run, both, shops, one, day, a, very, handsome, man, walks, into, the, shop, even, though, amy, is, engaged, she, becomes, friends, with, this, man, and, falls, passionately, in, love, with, him, and, he, with, her, they, decide, to, marry, that, is, until, one, day, when, amy, finds, a, book, in, the, attic, with, both, her, and, her, fianc, eacute, s, names, written, in, it, just, what, was, this, book, there, were, other, women, s, names, from, the, family, written, in, it, whom, she, recognizes, as, she, reads, the, rest, of, it, there, is, more, it, also, has, some, sort, of, spell, stating, that, whoever, s, name, appears, in, this, book, is, subject, to, the, curse, of, the, widowed, bride, what, is, this, is, this, a, curse, is, this, a, joke, who, did, this, who, got, in, this, attic, and, wrote, her, name, in, this, book, it, s, time, to, call, grandma, amy, needs, help, and, fast, this, was, a, very, good, book, the, author, wrote, this, in, a, very, engaging, way, the, plot, was, laid, out, very, well, and, the, characters, were, well, developed, this, story, keeps, your, interest, because, once, you, start, reading, this, story, you, are, not, going, to, stop, you, can, t, you, have, to, know, how, this, turns, out, even, though, the, description, of, the, story, is, written, above, it, is, very, sketchy, and, there, are, no, spoilers, there, is, so, much, more, to, this, story, that, it, will, surprise, you, it, is, well, worth, your, time, to, read, this, enjoyable, book, i, won, this, ebook, as, a, giveaway, from, the, freedom, hop, giveaway, we, just, had, from, the, publisher, livingston, hall, publishers, this, is, the, first, urban, fantasy, i, have, ever, read, i, enjoyed, it, very, much, i, will, have, to, stretch, further, and, read, more, of, these, as, a, matter, of, fact, in, the, back, of, the, book, the, author, has, included, the, first, two, chapters, of, another, book, she, has, written, called, the, apothecary, well, i, already, went, to, amazon, and, downloaded, the, ebook, check, it, out, both, books, are, only, 99, cents, laurie, carlson]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |446   |\n",
      "|\"A Work in Progress\" by Staci Stallings is a Christian Romance. I really enjoyed it! I was first drawn in by the endearing cover. Then I got into the story of Rebecca and Eric. I like that they are young college students that go through the same dilemmas and insecurities that college students truly go through daily... \"I don't look good enough.\"... \"I'm a failure.\"... \"I'm not popular.\"... \"He won't like me.\"... \"She won't like my.\"  - just to name a few. I love the way she weaves Scripture and sermonettes into the story.I definitely recommend \"A Work in Progress\" and all of Staci Stallings books to anyone who enjoys Christian Romance. I can hardly wait to read the next book in the series, \"A Little Bit of Heaven\".

      "|\"Abused\" is a short story, written from a child's point of view as she sees her mother suffer at the hands of an abusive father/husband. We see the main character, Emily, grow from child to adult, and get to see how the abuse affects her and her siblings as they reach adulthood. It's a sad, but well-written story. Just a note- I see that people have criticized the shortness of it but honestly, I felt that it was just the right length. It really wasn't that short, and I enjoyed the read.

      "|\"After the Night\", written by Rachel Dax, was the first book ever put on my new Kindle.  It is still on there and recently I had the chance to re-read it.  It will be staying on my Kindle to be read again in the future.  It is that good.Young nurse, Leah Webster, is thrust into a world strange and foreign to her. Cool, remote Officer Jean MacFarlane is assigned to show her the women's prison where she will be working.  First impressions are not always what they seem, though, and Leah soon discovers that `Mac', as she is known to some of the prisoners, is a kind and fair overseer of the prisoners in her care.  The cold, stone walls of the prison have seen much tragedy, as has Officer Jean MacFarlane, but Leah's joining of the staff provides a chance at healing and change for those around her. Leah, herself, learns to see the world much differently as a result of her interaction with the personalities she meets.  While the bars and doors of an institution cannot constrain love, the social mores of the time can be crueler than any locked cell.Ms. Dax successfully captures the mood and temperament, not only of the times it covers, but also of what it was like for women in the British penal system of the 1960's.The need to be discreet in our not too distant past is made palpable by Ms. Dax's economy of words and her spot-on dialogue.  The restrictive mood of the prison and of life outside the prison was viscerally felt while reading this story.  Rachel's research into her subject matter is impeccable. Personalities come alive, and the weaving together of the storyline's threads is flawless.Romantic scenes can be difficult to write, so I've been told, but Ms. Dax handles them with just the right amount of `heat'.  The main characters' growing attraction to each other is well paced and believable.  And the drama of life both inside and outside the prison makes for a compelling read.I highly recommend \"After the Night\" for your Kindle collection. You, too, may want to keep it on there to be read more than once.After The Night                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |[after, the, night, written, by, rachel, dax, was, the, first, book, ever, put, on, my, new, kindle, it, is, still, on, there, and, recently, i, had, the, chance, to, re, read, it, it, will, be, staying, on, my, kindle, to, be, read, again, in, the, future, it, is, that, good, young, nurse, leah, webster, is, thrust, into, a, world, strange, and, foreign, to, her, cool, remote, officer, jean, macfarlane, is, assigned, to, show, her, the, women, s, prison, where, she, will, be, working, first, impressions, are, not, always, what, they, seem, though, and, leah, soon, discovers, that, mac, as, she, is, known, to, some, of, the, prisoners, is, a, kind, and, fair, overseer, of, the, prisoners, in, her, care, the, cold, stone, walls, of, the, prison, have, seen, much, tragedy, as, has, officer, jean, macfarlane, but, leah, s, joining, of, the, staff, provides, a, chance, at, healing, and, change, for, those, around, her, leah, herself, learns, to, see, the, world, much, differently, as, a, result, of, her, interaction, with, the, personalities, she, meets, while, the, bars, and, doors, of, an, institution, cannot, constrain, love, the, social, mores, of, the, time, can, be, crueler, than, any, locked, cell, ms, dax, successfully, captures, the, mood, and, temperament, not, only, of, the, times, it, covers, but, also, of, what, it, was, like, for, women, in, the, british, penal, system, of, the, 1960, s, the, need, to, be, discreet, in, our, not, too, distant, past, is, made, palpable, by, ms, dax, s, economy, of, words, and, her, spot, on, dialogue, the, restrictive, mood, of, the, prison, and, of, life, outside, the, prison, was, viscerally, felt, while, reading, this, story, rachel, s, research, into, her, subject, matter, is, impeccable, personalities, come, alive, and, the, weaving, together, of, the, storyline, s, threads, is, flawless, romantic, scenes, can, be, difficult, to, write, so, i, ve, been, told, but, ms, dax, handles, them, with, just, the, right, amount, of, heat, the, main, characters, growing, attraction, to, each, other, is, well, paced, and, believable, and, the, drama, of, life, both, inside, and, outside, the, prison, makes, for, a, compelling, read, i, highly, recommend, after, the, night, for, your, kindle, collection, you, too, may, want, to, keep, it, on, there, to, be, read, more, than, once, after, the, night]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |379   |\n",
      "|\"Alaska be Damned!\" by Robert Hatting is an interesting and fascinating read.It begins with the rescue of a ship in stormy weathers. Very descriptive and moody I was taken in by the writing at once and enjoyed watching the characters and the story unfold. While I was thoroughly loved the amount of detail and background information given about Alaska and its history, a small romantic part would have liked to stay clear of politics and that part of the plot as it moved forward.Well written and featuring interesting characters this is well worth a read.

      "|\"Am I real,\" is the question the android Lucian asks by way of interacting with his human wife, Adriana, and daughter, Rose. Further, \"What does it mean to be real?\" Rachel Swirsky's short story is not new in the genre of human and android interactions and in asking the question what exactly is the difference between created life and natural life. The flash backs kept me interested, and the daughter's confusion over what she is was worth dwelling on, but ultimately the story disappoints. In the end, Lucian's quest is unfulfilled and unclear. How he means to find himself in the end is never explained. The reader is not let in on the secret of motives, only given a snapshot. Technically well written, but not very enjoyable and the questions posed are not new. For me, it was a resounding [shrug].

      "|\"America's Forgotten History, Part One\" by Mark David Ledbetter is the American history book that I wish we had had when I was in high school in the 1950s-1960s. I wish that high schools were using it today. The author does a marvelous job of relating the how and why, not just the who, when, and where that many history books focus on, and he does it with a style that grabs the reader immediately like a great novel. (Even though we know the ending!)Part One includes America's beginnings through the War of 1812 and covers the presidencies of George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. America's beginnings were actually in Europe, particularly England, dating back to the English Civil War in the mid-17th century. In a manner that reminded me of the old TV series \"Connections,\" the author, like James Burke, demonstrated how interconnected events in England and other countries influenced the colonists in America. Mr. Ledbetter's connection of the American Civil war to the English Civil War was one of the most remarkable conclusions that I've read in an American history book.But most of the story the author weaves is from the earliest settlements along the Atlantic coast through the War of 1812. He gives a good sense of how chaotic the years following the revolution were, especially as the state delegates met to draft the Constitution, and afterward as the members of the three branches - Executive, Legislative, and Judicial - worked to carve out their place in the new government. During these years the battle raged between advocates of a small, limited federal government and those who wanted a very strong federal government. That battle continues to this day, but the trend toward a strong federal government, to the detriment of the states, clearly began in the earliest days of the new republic.In short, \"America's Forgotten History, Part One\" is a superb look at the founding of the United States from the earliest colonial settlements through the early 19th century. I recommend it very highly for anyone who enjoys reading about the history of our country. You may or may not agree with all of the author's conclusions, but they're well written, rational arguments.Two thumbs up and five stars for \"America's Forgotten History, Part One.\" I'm looking forward to reading the other parts of this series.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |[america, s, forgotten, history, part, one, by, mark, david, ledbetter, is, the, american, history, book, that, i, wish, we, had, had, when, i, was, in, high, school, in, the, 1950s, 1960s, i, wish, that, high, schools, were, using, it, today, the, author, does, a, marvelous, job, of, relating, the, how, and, why, not, just, the, who, when, and, where, that, many, history, books, focus, on, and, he, does, it, with, a, style, that, grabs, the, reader, immediately, like, a, great, novel, even, though, we, know, the, ending, part, one, includes, america, s, beginnings, through, the, war, of, 1812, and, covers, the, presidencies, of, george, washington, john, adams, thomas, jefferson, and, james, madison, america, s, beginnings, were, actually, in, europe, particularly, england, dating, back, to, the, english, civil, war, in, the, mid, 17th, century, in, a, manner, that, reminded, me, of, the, old, tv, series, connections, the, author, like, james, burke, demonstrated, how, interconnected, events, in, england, and, other, countries, influenced, the, colonists, in, america, mr, ledbetter, s, connection, of, the, american, civil, war, to, the, english, civil, war, was, one, of, the, most, remarkable, conclusions, that, i, ve, read, in, an, american, history, book, but, most, of, the, story, the, author, weaves, is, from, the, earliest, settlements, along, the, atlantic, coast, through, the, war, of, 1812, he, gives, a, good, sense, of, how, chaotic, the, years, following, the, revolution, were, especially, as, the, state, delegates, met, to, draft, the, constitution, and, afterward, as, the, members, of, the, three, branches, executive, legislative, and, judicial, worked, to, carve, out, their, place, in, the, new, government, during, these, years, the, battle, raged, between, advocates, of, a, small, limited, federal, government, and, those, who, wanted, a, very, strong, federal, government, that, battle, continues, to, this, day, but, the, trend, toward, a, strong, federal, government, to, the, detriment, of, the, states, clearly, began, in, the, earliest, days, of, the, new, republic, in, short, america, s, forgotten, history, part, one, is, a, superb, look, at, the, founding, of, the, united, states, from, the, earliest, colonial, settlements, through, the, early, 19th, century, i, recommend, it, very, highly, for, anyone, who, enjoys, reading, about, the, history, of, our, country, you, may, or, may, not, agree, with, all, of, the, author, s, conclusions, but, they, re, well, written, rational, arguments, two, thumbs, up, and, five, stars, for, america, s, forgotten, history, part, one, i, m, looking, forward, to, reading, the, other, parts, of, this, series]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |406   |\n",
      "|\"And when you do, it's like Russian roulette. When the chamber comes up full, you don't get a second chance.\" - Stephen BarnesRiley Toback never plans to go back to jail. after serving four years for armed robbery, he is now making a fresh start in Atlantic City. he gets married to Carol and has a job he enjoys at Sully's Garage. despite the challenges, Riley feels good about everything because everything is way better than prison until his brother-in-law Joey makes a proposition. Joey asks Riley to help him pull a heist at a Jersey Shore nightclub but the job gets botched up. not only does it leave a bloody aftermath but it also earns them the ire of gangster Karim Rashid. Karim and his henchmen track them down and Riley - to save himself and his wife - ends up as a contestant in a deadly twisted game of Russian roulette called Triple Six.Roll of the Die is a one-way trip to a dark underground of high stakes players. it is edgy and gritty entertainment that echoes the bloodlust of Roman spectators. its violent theme is not for the faint-hearted but it is a very compelling read.amidst the savagery is a story of love and sacrifice. Riley and his co-participants face the greatest challenge of their lives. it spells deliverance or damnation either for themselves or for their loved ones.i was mesmerized by the plot and by author Sean Bridges' storytelling. this book may not be for everyone but i highly recommend it.for me, it is an honest and brutal depiction of how far man will go at the expense of his fellow men. it is also about how choices and a bit of luck in a game of chance can redeem or forfeit one's life.Disclosure of Material Connection: i received a copy of Roll of the Die from the author himself. i did not

      "|\"Angel Be Good\" is a modern day take on \"A Christmas Carol.\" The two main characters, Nat and Daphne, spend the night reviewing Nat's life and working on changing his attitude toward the world. I really like Daphne. The author spent time and effort developing her character. But it didn't seem as much effort was put into Nat. His character facilitated too often to make him believable. Like any \"Christmas Carol\" story, you want to see the person come to a epiphany that changes their character and makes the world a better place. This story reached that point a little too easily and a little too dramatically -- You need a kidney? Here take one of mine.Overall, it was an easy story to read, get into, and stay in, despite a few minor shortcomings.

      "|\"Anvil of Tears\" starts slow but soon picks up the pace and turns into a fast paced story with good characterizations and a plot that is somewhat unique in its genre. It kept my interest well and I came to care about the protagonists.But, it does need editing and adverb removal would be a good idea. It is a little wordy at times and some of the descriptions would be better served by the \"less is more\" theory.Overall I recommend it for a good Sci-Fi novel that keeps the reader guessing and

      "|\"Ashar'an  Rising (Nexus Wars Saga) is the second of a potential 5 to 7 book fantasy adventure series by author Robert Day. This Kindle e-edition only book is a 718 Kb download and retails for $2.99.General Theme *SPOILERS* (no specific details revealed)This book picks up were the first ended. However it differs from book one in that it follows several important people from a group that split up at the end of the first book. Val goes south towards Dak'mar, Kitara and Andrak go west toward the elven city of Lloreander while Kyle and Thorgast head north to the Barbarian city of Chul'hara.*END SPOILERS*The Pros:1a.) a definite improvement in the quality of  prose and story-telling by author Day over the first novel.1b.) hard to put a finger on, but there seemed to be a more palpable edginess to some the action scenes...a can't wait to turn the page to find out what happens sensation. I found this particularly true in some of the battles and during the cave treks.2.) better character development (even some of the bad guys). The author has spent some time bringing a sense of personality and perspective to many of his important characters.3.) spoiler...as with the first book, the unexpected demise of some important characters. BRAVO...nothing worse or more unbelievable in a fantasy adventure then having all your good guys sacrosanct.3.) a really good map. This is a story that appears to be expanding geographically. The map also has a distance scale so if you care (and I do) you can get a feel for the leagues between point A and point B on quests. This allows a reader to appreciate the time element (as well as the distance) spent traveling. This story, without a map, would be greatly diminished.4.) stunning cover art. I often wonder if authors (especially if the author is relatively unknown) realize how this can make or break a readers decision to buy a book or not...if it doesn't catch your eye right off...Concerns: (really only one)About a third of the way into this book, the story gets sidetracked with a prolonged historical description of the origins of good and evil factions and their ensuing conflicts that resulted in the Portal gates being placed on the world of Kil'Tar. Here's my peeve...while I like to know 'some' background material regarding important structures within a story, BUT not to be point of bringing the entire main story to a grinding halt. This type of info could be adequately revealed to the reader by brief dialogues between characters...rather than a show-stopping flashback.Conclusion:A very good second book...complete with all the normal trappings you'd expect in a well written fantasy tale...battles, magic, treks, interesting characters etc. This is a novel that gravitates to many diverse arrays of situational encounters...if you looking for lots of fantasy action  with some interesting narrative inbetween engagements, then this is a book you'll enjoy. Unfortunately it did have a small break in the mainstream tale as per my concern mentioned above...however still 5 Stars.Ray Nicholson|[ashar, an, rising, nexus, wars, saga, is, the, second, of, a, potential, 5, to, 7, book, fantasy, adventure, series, by, author, robert, day, this, kindle, e, edition, only, book, is, a, 718, kb, download, and, retails, for, 2, 99, general, theme, spoilers, no, specific, details, revealed, this, book, picks, up, were, the, first, ended, however, it, differs, from, book, one, in, that, it, follows, several, important, people, from, a, group, that, split, up, at, the, end, of, the, first, book, val, goes, south, towards, dak, mar, kitara, and, andrak, go, west, toward, the, elven, city, of, lloreander, while, kyle, and, thorgast, head, north, to, the, barbarian, city, of, chul, hara, end, spoilers, the, pros, 1a, a, definite, improvement, in, the, quality, of, prose, and, story, telling, by, author, day, over, the, first, novel, 1b, hard, to, put, a, finger, on, but, there, seemed, to, be, a, more, palpable, edginess, to, some, the, action, scenes, a, can, t, wait, to, turn, the, page, to, find, out, what, happens, sensation, i, found, this, particularly, true, in, some, of, the, battles, and, during, the, cave, treks, 2, better, character, development, even, some, of, the, bad, guys, the, author, has, spent, some, time, bringing, a, sense, of, personality, and, perspective, to, many, of, his, important, characters, 3, spoiler, as, with, the, first, book, the, unexpected, demise, of, some, important, characters, bravo, nothing, worse, or, more, unbelievable, in, a, fantasy, adventure, then, having, all, your, good, guys, sacrosanct, 3, a, really, good, map, this, is, a, story, that, appears, to, be, expanding, geographically, the, map, also, has, a, distance, scale, so, if, you, care, and, i, do, you, can, get, a, feel, for, the, leagues, between, point, a, and, point, b, on, quests, this, allows, a, reader, to, appreciate, the, time, element, as, well, as, the, distance, spent, traveling, this, story, without, a, map, would, be, greatly, diminished, 4, stunning, cover, art, i, often, wonder, if, authors, especially, if, the, author, is, relatively, unknown, realize, how, this, can, make, or, break, a, readers, decision, to, buy, a, book, or, not, if, it, doesn, t, catch, your, eye, right, off, concerns, really, only, one, about, a, third, of, the, way, into, this, book, the, story, gets, sidetracked, with, a, prolonged, historical, description, of, the, origins, of, good, and, evil, factions, and, their, ensuing, conflicts, that, resulted, in, the, portal, gates, being, placed, on, the, world, of, kil, tar, here, s, my, peeve, while, i, like, to, know, some, background, material, regarding, important, structures, within, a, story, but, not, to, be, point, of, bringing, the, entire, main, story, to, a, grinding, halt, this, type, of, info, could, be, adequately, revealed, to, the, reader, by, brief, dialogues, between, characters, rather, than, a, show, stopping, flashback, conclusion, a, very, good, second, book, complete, with, all, the, normal, trappings, you, d, expect, in, a, well, written, fantasy, tale, battles, magic, treks, interesting, characters, etc, this, is, a, novel, that, gravitates, to, many, diverse, arrays, of, situational, encounters, if, you, looking, for, lots, of, fantasy, action, with, some, interesting, narrative, inbetween, engagements, then, this, is, a, book, you, ll, enjoy, unfortunately, it, did, have, a, small, break, in, the, mainstream, tale, as, per, my, concern, mentioned, above, however, still, 5, stars, ray, nicholson]|542   |\n",

      "|!!!!??? (sorry couldn't explain what I'm feeling other than by using words that might not be very appropriate for a public website) :)Not only could I just not put down the book, but I was totally exhausted from all the actions and emotions ! There isn't a single boring page, and the mix of fright, worry, sadness (I am SO missing Pete), horror and the frantic pace of the story really made reading this book an awesome experience.One thing is sure, I never ever want to be in Lorne's shoes lol !A recommended read. I liked Cruel Justice. This one is definitely as good.

      "|\"'Looking Through Lace\" 'is the story of Toni, a xenolinguist who is assigned to work with a first contact team. She's been relegated to doing grunt work until now, and is really excited for the opportunity to prove herself.The alien world in '\"Looking Through Lace\" 'is fascinating - although the inhabitants are descended from humans, they have a unique history and culture. The women speak an entirely different language among themselves that the men are not allowed to learn, and Toni is determined to figure out how and why that happened. However, she has a jealous senior colleague and the affections of an attractive native (who just happens to be in a group marriage) to contend with.I enjoyed reading a science-fiction story by Nestvold; all the other work I've read by her has been fantasy. She keeps up the excellent worldbuilding and characters. I found the revelations concerning the history of the world very interesting. The antagonist xenolinguist seemed like a bit of a caricature, but the interesting alien world more than made up for it.

      "|\"*69\" starts with an interesting concept: what if someone's cell phone inadvertently called you while that person was committing a murder? Pretty creepy, especially if you've ever gotten one of those odd calls where there's no one on the other line, but you can hear something like breathing or some kind of commotion. In Blake's story, after the initial phone call, there's a quaintness to the married couple pondering who might have called and whether they actually overheard someone's murder. But the story quickly ramps up as their suspicions escalate and their actions to learn the truth cross a couple of lines. A really strong opener for this collection.\"Remaking\" is a tragic bit of work strikes a nerve considering the number of times you hear about a child abduction on the six-o-clock news. If I had to pick a runt from this litter of stories, \"Remaking\" would be it, but it's still one that kept me hooked until the end because the man's torment and how it threatened the safety of the child was chilling.\"On the Good, Red Road\" is a western that acts as a prelude of sorts to a novel of Blake's called Abandon. A man tries to make his way to a mining town, but winds up in the couple of a trio of outlaws. Things are tense enough as the guy tries to gauge how best to get away from the villains, but when a sudden blizzard leaves them stranded and starving in the middle of nowhere, that's when it really turns into a nail-biter.\"Shining Rock\" struck me as a story with a really strong start and finish, but there was a piece in the middle that strained my credulity. A married couple are on a romantic excursion in the bucolic fields of a park called Shining Rock, and are approached by a lone man from a neighboring campsite who at first seems off-putting with his large knife, but ultimately charms them with smalltalk and pricey booze. But there's something about the lone man and his brief tale of tragedy during drunken chatter that sets the husband on edge and has him wanting to flee the park as soon as possible. I really liked the story overall, but there was one aspect of the wife's reaction to her husband's revelation that didn't feel believable to me. Aside from that, it was probably my favorite story of the four.It's a nice hodgepodge for anyone who'd care to check out Blake's work for the first time. A little bit of everything, from western to psychological thriller, to horror. There's a larger collection on the Kindle Store called Fully Loaded, which includes these four stories and a bunch more (his collaboration with J.A. Konrath, Serial, among them), so I'll have to check that out sometime, too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |[69, starts, with, an, interesting, concept, what, if, someone, s, cell, phone, inadvertently, called, you, while, that, person, was, committing, a, murder, pretty, creepy, especially, if, you, ve, ever, gotten, one, of, those, odd, calls, where, there, s, no, one, on, the, other, line, but, you, can, hear, something, like, breathing, or, some, kind, of, commotion, in, blake, s, story, after, the, initial, phone, call, there, s, a, quaintness, to, the, married, couple, pondering, who, might, have, called, and, whether, they, actually, overheard, someone, s, murder, but, the, story, quickly, ramps, up, as, their, suspicions, escalate, and, their, actions, to, learn, the, truth, cross, a, couple, of, lines, a, really, strong, opener, for, this, collection, remaking, is, a, tragic, bit, of, work, strikes, a, nerve, considering, the, number, of, times, you, hear, about, a, child, abduction, on, the, six, o, clock, news, if, i, had, to, pick, a, runt, from, this, litter, of, stories, remaking, would, be, it, but, it, s, still, one, that, kept, me, hooked, until, the, end, because, the, man, s, torment, and, how, it, threatened, the, safety, of, the, child, was, chilling, on, the, good, red, road, is, a, western, that, acts, as, a, prelude, of, sorts, to, a, novel, of, blake, s, called, abandon, a, man, tries, to, make, his, way, to, a, mining, town, but, winds, up, in, the, couple, of, a, trio, of, outlaws, things, are, tense, enough, as, the, guy, tries, to, gauge, how, best, to, get, away, from, the, villains, but, when, a, sudden, blizzard, leaves, them, stranded, and, starving, in, the, middle, of, nowhere, that, s, when, it, really, turns, into, a, nail, biter, shining, rock, struck, me, as, a, story, with, a, really, strong, start, and, finish, but, there, was, a, piece, in, the, middle, that, strained, my, credulity, a, married, couple, are, on, a, romantic, excursion, in, the, bucolic, fields, of, a, park, called, shining, rock, and, are, approached, by, a, lone, man, from, a, neighboring, campsite, who, at, first, seems, off, putting, with, his, large, knife, but, ultimately, charms, them, with, smalltalk, and, pricey, booze, but, there, s, something, about, the, lone, man, and, his, brief, tale, of, tragedy, during, drunken, chatter, that, sets, the, husband, on, edge, and, has, him, wanting, to, flee, the, park, as, soon, as, possible, i, really, liked, the, story, overall, but, there, was, one, aspect, of, the, wife, s, reaction, to, her, husband, s, revelation, that, didn, t, feel, believable, to, me, aside, from, that, it, was, probably, my, favorite, story, of, the, four, it, s, a, nice, hodgepodge, for, anyone, who, d, care, to, check, out, blake, s, work, for, the, first, time, a, little, bit, of, everything, from, western, to, psychological, thriller, to, horror, there, s, a, larger, collection, on, the, kindle, store, called, fully, loaded, which, includes, these, four, stories, and, a, bunch, more, his, collaboration, with, j, a, konrath, serial, among, them, so, i, ll, have, to, check, that, out, sometime, too]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |495   |\n",
      "|\"... Couldn't you at least sin a little? You're supposed to be a princess of Hell.\"And with that we meet Lucifer.  Satan.  The One and Only.  The Big Bad.  And let me tell you, he is awesome.  And in this story Satan is a dad.  And he is funny and snarky and quick-witted, just like his daughter, Muriel.  Sure, he's still got a job to do running Hell and all, but he also has a 23 year old daughter to look after, and she is a hand full!Meet Muriel. She still holds her V-card, but she owns a bar.  She wants to make it on her own, and she wants to make it with a man (but don't tell her dad, he'd be elated!)  Ok, so those are two different versions of \"make it\" but who is counting? So when Mr. Gorgeous and Full of Hotness himself walks into her bar, she's left breathing a little heavy.Let's meet Auric. Everything about him is best left for you to find out.  But I will tell you he is hot, scarred, and he makes me wish I was Satan's daughter too.I loved this story!  It had everything that I look for.  Funny and smart woman?  Check.  Super-freakin-hot man? Check.  Danger and intrigue? Check.  Impossible situations, secrets and intense heat? Check check check! In a great style I have quickly come to associate with all things Eve Langlais, Lucifer's Daughter knocks this one right out of the park.  And Muriel has a rocking fashion sense on top of it all.  Demons, hellhounds, succubi, shifters, angels, and more.I found Auric to be a formidable match for Muriel.  I love him.  From his very beginning gruffness, to an unusual display of love set to music (ahem, which was all too perfect after Googling to get the scoop for myself), to his alpha personality and bottomless love for Muriel.  And he has a scar.  Scars are definitely sexy, maybe even more so than tattoos! Auric doesn't show all of his cards at once, he slowly lets out his wonderfulness.  And I'm hooked.  I want to read a hundred books all set around this green eyed, raven haired beauty of a man.Muriel is perfectly written.  She is a tough girl, and she is smart.  She wants to be independent, but she is still her father's daughter.  She has weapons and power, and great style.  Her family (which is sizable) loves her.  She lit up the pages with her wit and attitude.  Her past has secrets that I can't wait to get the answers to - like who is her mother??I loved this book that I went right to Amazon and purchased the next in the series, Snowballs in Hell.  So stay close for a review of that in the upcoming weeks, and also the Freakn' Shifters series which I have coming up too!Ok, one more quote from Lucifer's Daughter:\"You're making me look like a bad parent.

      "|\"A Hard Man is Good to Find\" takes match-making to a new extreme.  Knowing that her two closest friends were perfect for one another - if they would stop hating each other long enough to figure it out - Callie left her house to both of them under the condition that they live in it together for one year.  After the year was up, they could either sell it and split the proceeds or, as she had hoped, live there together having \"wild monkey sex in every room of the house at least once a day.\"  Kelsey and Clint had not expected this to say the least when they attended the reading of the will of their recently departed very close friend.Kelsey is an independent woman who becomes enraged just about every time she is near Clint Duncan, although she is not oblivious to the fact that her nipples are almost always erect in his presence as well.  She is simultaneously infuriated and completely turned on by him.  Clint's reaction to Kelsey, both physically and emotionally, is pretty much the same.  The reader is treated to a perhaps predictable tale where the two protagonists slowly begin to overlook their irritation and expose their infatuation for one another.One thing that I really liked about this book is that from the beginning, it was no secret that Kelsey is in fact a spankophile.  She references spanking in the first few pages and quickly delves into a spanky daydream featuring her nemesis, Clint, himself.I like the majority of Carolyn Faulkner's spanking fiction.  She writes very well and draws the reader in.  Her books seem to follow the typical romance novel template: ordinary woman meets tall hunk and initially HATES him - but eventually starts to see his finer qualities.  They eventually have a whirl wind romance and declare complete and total devotion to one another.  The only difference is that Carolyn's template includes a session over the knee of the tall hunk every chapter or so (which I have to say is a great twist on the typical romance novel).  I am a huge fan of Carolyn Faulkner as I love occasionally getting lost in a tale of love and spanking.  If you are looking to spend an afternoon like this, then I would definitely recommend you pick up a copy of \"A Hard Man is Good to Find.\"Katerina of BottomsUpBookReview                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |[a, hard, man, is, good, to, find, takes, match, making, to, a, new, extreme, knowing, that, her, two, closest, friends, were, perfect, for, one, another, if, they, would, stop, hating, each, other, long, enough, to, figure, it, out, callie, left, her, house, to, both, of, them, under, the, condition, that, they, live, in, it, together, for, one, year, after, the, year, was, up, they, could, either, sell, it, and, split, the, proceeds, or, as, she, had, hoped, live, there, together, having, wild, monkey, sex, in, every, room, of, the, house, at, least, once, a, day, kelsey, and, clint, had, not, expected, this, to, say, the, least, when, they, attended, the, reading, of, the, will, of, their, recently, departed, very, close, friend, kelsey, is, an, independent, woman, who, becomes, enraged, just, about, every, time, she, is, near, clint, duncan, although, she, is, not, oblivious, to, the, fact, that, her, nipples, are, almost, always, erect, in, his, presence, as, well, she, is, simultaneously, infuriated, and, completely, turned, on, by, him, clint, s, reaction, to, kelsey, both, physically, and, emotionally, is, pretty, much, the, same, the, reader, is, treated, to, a, perhaps, predictable, tale, where, the, two, protagonists, slowly, begin, to, overlook, their, irritation, and, expose, their, infatuation, for, one, another, one, thing, that, i, really, liked, about, this, book, is, that, from, the, beginning, it, was, no, secret, that, kelsey, is, in, fact, a, spankophile, she, references, spanking, in, the, first, few, pages, and, quickly, delves, into, a, spanky, daydream, featuring, her, nemesis, clint, himself, i, like, the, majority, of, carolyn, faulkner, s, spanking, fiction, she, writes, very, well, and, draws, the, reader, in, her, books, seem, to, follow, the, typical, romance, novel, template, ordinary, woman, meets, tall, hunk, and, initially, hates, him, but, eventually, starts, to, see, his, finer, qualities, they, eventually, have, a, whirl, wind, romance, and, declare, complete, and, total, devotion, to, one, another, the, only, difference, is, that, carolyn, s, template, includes, a, session, over, the, knee, of, the, tall, hunk, every, chapter, or, so, which, i, have, to, say, is, a, great, twist, on, the, typical, romance, novel, i, am, a, huge, fan, of, carolyn, faulkner, as, i, love, occasionally, getting, lost, in, a, tale, of, love, and, spanking, if, you, are, looking, to, spend, an, afternoon, like, this, then, i, would, definitely, recommend, you, pick, up, a, copy, of, a, hard, man, is, good, to, find, katerina, of, bottomsupbookreview]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |403   |\n",
      "|\"A Hero for Jessica\" is well written. The short story format lends itself expertly to Kindle users. Mrs. Thibodeaux introduces readers to Paul, a successful, handsome, and reluctant to fall in love attorney. Jessica needs to find an attorney to help her with some frightening and frustrating personal problems. She is a successful author. Paul and Jessica discover they not only love each other, but they are perfect heroes. Jessica finds her hero. Paul finds his heroine.I have read almost all of Pamela Thibodeaux's short stories and novels. She is an excellent author. She takes readers on journeys without losing sight of God.

      "|\"A Secret in the Attic\" byA very intriguing and engaging story about a magic spell set by a jealous friend of the family decades ago to ruin the lives of future generations of women in this family wanting to marry the loves of their lives.  Oh, they can marry, but the consequences are not what they desire.Amy's Grandmother had just given her the bookstore and coffee shop she owned for her twenty-first birthday.  Her Grandmother,  now retired, sets off to travel with a friend.  Amy, now the owner, is left to run both shops.One day a very handsome man walks into the shop.  Even though Amy is engaged, she becomes friends with this man and falls passionately in love with him, and he, with her.They decide to marry, that is, until one day when Amy finds a book in the attic with both her and her fianc&eacute;s names written in it.  Just what was this book?  There were other women's names from the family written in it whom she recognizes as she reads the rest of it.  There is more.  It also has some sort of spell stating that whoever's name appears in this book is `Subject to the curse of the Widowed Bride'?  What is this?  Is this a curse?  Is this a joke?  Who did this?  Who got in this attic and wrote her name in this book?It's time to call Grandma.  Amy needs help and fast.This was a very good book.  The author wrote this in a very engaging way.  The plot was laid out very well and the characters were well developed.  This story keeps your interest because once you start reading this story, you are not going to stop.  You can't.  You have to know how this turns out.Even though the description of the story is written above, it is very sketchy and there are no spoilers.  There is so much more to this story that it will surprise you.  It is well worth your time to read this enjoyable book.I won this Ebook as a Giveaway from the Freedom Hop Giveaway we just had, from the Publisher, Livingston Hall Publishers.  This is the first Urban Fantasy I have ever read.  I enjoyed it very much.  I will have to stretch further and read more of these.As a matter of fact, in the back of the book, the author has included the first two chapters of another book she has written, called \"The Apothecary\".  Well, I already went to Amazon and downloaded the Ebook!  Check it out.  Both books are only 99 cents.Laurie Carlson                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |[a, secret, in, the, attic, bya, very, intriguing, and, engaging, story, about, a, magic, spell, set, by, a, jealous, friend, of, the, family, decades, ago, to, ruin, the, lives, of, future, generations, of, women, in, this, family, wanting, to, marry, the, loves, of, their, lives, oh, they, can, marry, but, the, consequences, are, not, what, they, desire, amy, s, grandmother, had, just, given, her, the, bookstore, and, coffee, shop, she, owned, for, her, twenty, first, birthday, her, grandmother, now, retired, sets, off, to, travel, with, a, friend, amy, now, the, owner, is, left, to, run, both, shops, one, day, a, very, handsome, man, walks, into, the, shop, even, though, amy, is, engaged, she, becomes, friends, with, this, man, and, falls, passionately, in, love, with, him, and, he, with, her, they, decide, to, marry, that, is, until, one, day, when, amy, finds, a, book, in, the, attic, with, both, her, and, her, fianc, eacute, s, names, written, in, it, just, what, was, this, book, there, were, other, women, s, names, from, the, family, written, in, it, whom, she, recognizes, as, she, reads, the, rest, of, it, there, is, more, it, also, has, some, sort, of, spell, stating, that, whoever, s, name, appears, in, this, book, is, subject, to, the, curse, of, the, widowed, bride, what, is, this, is, this, a, curse, is, this, a, joke, who, did, this, who, got, in, this, attic, and, wrote, her, name, in, this, book, it, s, time, to, call, grandma, amy, needs, help, and, fast, this, was, a, very, good, book, the, author, wrote, this, in, a, very, engaging, way, the, plot, was, laid, out, very, well, and, the, characters, were, well, developed, this, story, keeps, your, interest, because, once, you, start, reading, this, story, you, are, not, going, to, stop, you, can, t, you, have, to, know, how, this, turns, out, even, though, the, description, of, the, story, is, written, above, it, is, very, sketchy, and, there, are, no, spoilers, there, is, so, much, more, to, this, story, that, it, will, surprise, you, it, is, well, worth, your, time, to, read, this, enjoyable, book, i, won, this, ebook, as, a, giveaway, from, the, freedom, hop, giveaway, we, just, had, from, the, publisher, livingston, hall, publishers, this, is, the, first, urban, fantasy, i, have, ever, read, i, enjoyed, it, very, much, i, will, have, to, stretch, further, and, read, more, of, these, as, a, matter, of, fact, in, the, back, of, the, book, the, author, has, included, the, first, two, chapters, of, another, book, she, has, written, called, the, apothecary, well, i, already, went, to, amazon, and, downloaded, the, ebook, check, it, out, both, books, are, only, 99, cents, laurie, carlson]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |446   |\n",
      "|\"A Work in Progress\" by Staci Stallings is a Christian Romance. I really enjoyed it! I was first drawn in by the endearing cover. Then I got into the story of Rebecca and Eric. I like that they are young college students that go through the same dilemmas and insecurities that college students truly go through daily... \"I don't look good enough.\"... \"I'm a failure.\"... \"I'm not popular.\"... \"He won't like me.\"... \"She won't like my.\"  - just to name a few. I love the way she weaves Scripture and sermonettes into the story.I definitely recommend \"A Work in Progress\" and all of Staci Stallings books to anyone who enjoys Christian Romance. I can hardly wait to read the next book in the series, \"A Little Bit of Heaven\".

      "|\"Abused\" is a short story, written from a child's point of view as she sees her mother suffer at the hands of an abusive father/husband. We see the main character, Emily, grow from child to adult, and get to see how the abuse affects her and her siblings as they reach adulthood. It's a sad, but well-written story. Just a note- I see that people have criticized the shortness of it but honestly, I felt that it was just the right length. It really wasn't that short, and I enjoyed the read.

      "|\"After the Night\", written by Rachel Dax, was the first book ever put on my new Kindle.  It is still on there and recently I had the chance to re-read it.  It will be staying on my Kindle to be read again in the future.  It is that good.Young nurse, Leah Webster, is thrust into a world strange and foreign to her. Cool, remote Officer Jean MacFarlane is assigned to show her the women's prison where she will be working.  First impressions are not always what they seem, though, and Leah soon discovers that `Mac', as she is known to some of the prisoners, is a kind and fair overseer of the prisoners in her care.  The cold, stone walls of the prison have seen much tragedy, as has Officer Jean MacFarlane, but Leah's joining of the staff provides a chance at healing and change for those around her. Leah, herself, learns to see the world much differently as a result of her interaction with the personalities she meets.  While the bars and doors of an institution cannot constrain love, the social mores of the time can be crueler than any locked cell.Ms. Dax successfully captures the mood and temperament, not only of the times it covers, but also of what it was like for women in the British penal system of the 1960's.The need to be discreet in our not too distant past is made palpable by Ms. Dax's economy of words and her spot-on dialogue.  The restrictive mood of the prison and of life outside the prison was viscerally felt while reading this story.  Rachel's research into her subject matter is impeccable. Personalities come alive, and the weaving together of the storyline's threads is flawless.Romantic scenes can be difficult to write, so I've been told, but Ms. Dax handles them with just the right amount of `heat'.  The main characters' growing attraction to each other is well paced and believable.  And the drama of life both inside and outside the prison makes for a compelling read.I highly recommend \"After the Night\" for your Kindle collection. You, too, may want to keep it on there to be read more than once.After The Night                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |[after, the, night, written, by, rachel, dax, was, the, first, book, ever, put, on, my, new, kindle, it, is, still, on, there, and, recently, i, had, the, chance, to, re, read, it, it, will, be, staying, on, my, kindle, to, be, read, again, in, the, future, it, is, that, good, young, nurse, leah, webster, is, thrust, into, a, world, strange, and, foreign, to, her, cool, remote, officer, jean, macfarlane, is, assigned, to, show, her, the, women, s, prison, where, she, will, be, working, first, impressions, are, not, always, what, they, seem, though, and, leah, soon, discovers, that, mac, as, she, is, known, to, some, of, the, prisoners, is, a, kind, and, fair, overseer, of, the, prisoners, in, her, care, the, cold, stone, walls, of, the, prison, have, seen, much, tragedy, as, has, officer, jean, macfarlane, but, leah, s, joining, of, the, staff, provides, a, chance, at, healing, and, change, for, those, around, her, leah, herself, learns, to, see, the, world, much, differently, as, a, result, of, her, interaction, with, the, personalities, she, meets, while, the, bars, and, doors, of, an, institution, cannot, constrain, love, the, social, mores, of, the, time, can, be, crueler, than, any, locked, cell, ms, dax, successfully, captures, the, mood, and, temperament, not, only, of, the, times, it, covers, but, also, of, what, it, was, like, for, women, in, the, british, penal, system, of, the, 1960, s, the, need, to, be, discreet, in, our, not, too, distant, past, is, made, palpable, by, ms, dax, s, economy, of, words, and, her, spot, on, dialogue, the, restrictive, mood, of, the, prison, and, of, life, outside, the, prison, was, viscerally, felt, while, reading, this, story, rachel, s, research, into, her, subject, matter, is, impeccable, personalities, come, alive, and, the, weaving, together, of, the, storyline, s, threads, is, flawless, romantic, scenes, can, be, difficult, to, write, so, i, ve, been, told, but, ms, dax, handles, them, with, just, the, right, amount, of, heat, the, main, characters, growing, attraction, to, each, other, is, well, paced, and, believable, and, the, drama, of, life, both, inside, and, outside, the, prison, makes, for, a, compelling, read, i, highly, recommend, after, the, night, for, your, kindle, collection, you, too, may, want, to, keep, it, on, there, to, be, read, more, than, once, after, the, night]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |379   |\n",
      "|\"Alaska be Damned!\" by Robert Hatting is an interesting and fascinating read.It begins with the rescue of a ship in stormy weathers. Very descriptive and moody I was taken in by the writing at once and enjoyed watching the characters and the story unfold. While I was thoroughly loved the amount of detail and background information given about Alaska and its history, a small romantic part would have liked to stay clear of politics and that part of the plot as it moved forward.Well written and featuring interesting characters this is well worth a read.

      "|\"Am I real,\" is the question the android Lucian asks by way of interacting with his human wife, Adriana, and daughter, Rose. Further, \"What does it mean to be real?\" Rachel Swirsky's short story is not new in the genre of human and android interactions and in asking the question what exactly is the difference between created life and natural life. The flash backs kept me interested, and the daughter's confusion over what she is was worth dwelling on, but ultimately the story disappoints. In the end, Lucian's quest is unfulfilled and unclear. How he means to find himself in the end is never explained. The reader is not let in on the secret of motives, only given a snapshot. Technically well written, but not very enjoyable and the questions posed are not new. For me, it was a resounding [shrug].

      "|\"America's Forgotten History, Part One\" by Mark David Ledbetter is the American history book that I wish we had had when I was in high school in the 1950s-1960s. I wish that high schools were using it today. The author does a marvelous job of relating the how and why, not just the who, when, and where that many history books focus on, and he does it with a style that grabs the reader immediately like a great novel. (Even though we know the ending!)Part One includes America's beginnings through the War of 1812 and covers the presidencies of George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison. America's beginnings were actually in Europe, particularly England, dating back to the English Civil War in the mid-17th century. In a manner that reminded me of the old TV series \"Connections,\" the author, like James Burke, demonstrated how interconnected events in England and other countries influenced the colonists in America. Mr. Ledbetter's connection of the American Civil war to the English Civil War was one of the most remarkable conclusions that I've read in an American history book.But most of the story the author weaves is from the earliest settlements along the Atlantic coast through the War of 1812. He gives a good sense of how chaotic the years following the revolution were, especially as the state delegates met to draft the Constitution, and afterward as the members of the three branches - Executive, Legislative, and Judicial - worked to carve out their place in the new government. During these years the battle raged between advocates of a small, limited federal government and those who wanted a very strong federal government. That battle continues to this day, but the trend toward a strong federal government, to the detriment of the states, clearly began in the earliest days of the new republic.In short, \"America's Forgotten History, Part One\" is a superb look at the founding of the United States from the earliest colonial settlements through the early 19th century. I recommend it very highly for anyone who enjoys reading about the history of our country. You may or may not agree with all of the author's conclusions, but they're well written, rational arguments.Two thumbs up and five stars for \"America's Forgotten History, Part One.\" I'm looking forward to reading the other parts of this series.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |[america, s, forgotten, history, part, one, by, mark, david, ledbetter, is, the, american, history, book, that, i, wish, we, had, had, when, i, was, in, high, school, in, the, 1950s, 1960s, i, wish, that, high, schools, were, using, it, today, the, author, does, a, marvelous, job, of, relating, the, how, and, why, not, just, the, who, when, and, where, that, many, history, books, focus, on, and, he, does, it, with, a, style, that, grabs, the, reader, immediately, like, a, great, novel, even, though, we, know, the, ending, part, one, includes, america, s, beginnings, through, the, war, of, 1812, and, covers, the, presidencies, of, george, washington, john, adams, thomas, jefferson, and, james, madison, america, s, beginnings, were, actually, in, europe, particularly, england, dating, back, to, the, english, civil, war, in, the, mid, 17th, century, in, a, manner, that, reminded, me, of, the, old, tv, series, connections, the, author, like, james, burke, demonstrated, how, interconnected, events, in, england, and, other, countries, influenced, the, colonists, in, america, mr, ledbetter, s, connection, of, the, american, civil, war, to, the, english, civil, war, was, one, of, the, most, remarkable, conclusions, that, i, ve, read, in, an, american, history, book, but, most, of, the, story, the, author, weaves, is, from, the, earliest, settlements, along, the, atlantic, coast, through, the, war, of, 1812, he, gives, a, good, sense, of, how, chaotic, the, years, following, the, revolution, were, especially, as, the, state, delegates, met, to, draft, the, constitution, and, afterward, as, the, members, of, the, three, branches, executive, legislative, and, judicial, worked, to, carve, out, their, place, in, the, new, government, during, these, years, the, battle, raged, between, advocates, of, a, small, limited, federal, government, and, those, who, wanted, a, very, strong, federal, government, that, battle, continues, to, this, day, but, the, trend, toward, a, strong, federal, government, to, the, detriment, of, the, states, clearly, began, in, the, earliest, days, of, the, new, republic, in, short, america, s, forgotten, history, part, one, is, a, superb, look, at, the, founding, of, the, united, states, from, the, earliest, colonial, settlements, through, the, early, 19th, century, i, recommend, it, very, highly, for, anyone, who, enjoys, reading, about, the, history, of, our, country, you, may, or, may, not, agree, with, all, of, the, author, s, conclusions, but, they, re, well, written, rational, arguments, two, thumbs, up, and, five, stars, for, america, s, forgotten, history, part, one, i, m, looking, forward, to, reading, the, other, parts, of, this, series]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |406   |\n",
      "|\"And when you do, it's like Russian roulette. When the chamber comes up full, you don't get a second chance.\" - Stephen BarnesRiley Toback never plans to go back to jail. after serving four years for armed robbery, he is now making a fresh start in Atlantic City. he gets married to Carol and has a job he enjoys at Sully's Garage. despite the challenges, Riley feels good about everything because everything is way better than prison until his brother-in-law Joey makes a proposition. Joey asks Riley to help him pull a heist at a Jersey Shore nightclub but the job gets botched up. not only does it leave a bloody aftermath but it also earns them the ire of gangster Karim Rashid. Karim and his henchmen track them down and Riley - to save himself and his wife - ends up as a contestant in a deadly twisted game of Russian roulette called Triple Six.Roll of the Die is a one-way trip to a dark underground of high stakes players. it is edgy and gritty entertainment that echoes the bloodlust of Roman spectators. its violent theme is not for the faint-hearted but it is a very compelling read.amidst the savagery is a story of love and sacrifice. Riley and his co-participants face the greatest challenge of their lives. it spells deliverance or damnation either for themselves or for their loved ones.i was mesmerized by the plot and by author Sean Bridges' storytelling. this book may not be for everyone but i highly recommend it.for me, it is an honest and brutal depiction of how far man will go at the expense of his fellow men. it is also about how choices and a bit of luck in a game of chance can redeem or forfeit one's life.Disclosure of Material Connection: i received a copy of Roll of the Die from the author himself. i did not

      "|\"Angel Be Good\" is a modern day take on \"A Christmas Carol.\" The two main characters, Nat and Daphne, spend the night reviewing Nat's life and working on changing his attitude toward the world. I really like Daphne. The author spent time and effort developing her character. But it didn't seem as much effort was put into Nat. His character facilitated too often to make him believable. Like any \"Christmas Carol\" story, you want to see the person come to a epiphany that changes their character and makes the world a better place. This story reached that point a little too easily and a little too dramatically -- You need a kidney? Here take one of mine.Overall, it was an easy story to read, get into, and stay in, despite a few minor shortcomings.

      "|\"Anvil of Tears\" starts slow but soon picks up the pace and turns into a fast paced story with good characterizations and a plot that is somewhat unique in its genre. It kept my interest well and I came to care about the protagonists.But, it does need editing and adverb removal would be a good idea. It is a little wordy at times and some of the descriptions would be better served by the \"less is more\" theory.Overall I recommend it for a good Sci-Fi novel that keeps the reader guessing and

      "|\"Ashar'an  Rising (Nexus Wars Saga) is the second of a potential 5 to 7 book fantasy adventure series by author Robert Day. This Kindle e-edition only book is a 718 Kb download and retails for $2.99.General Theme *SPOILERS* (no specific details revealed)This book picks up were the first ended. However it differs from book one in that it follows several important people from a group that split up at the end of the first book. Val goes south towards Dak'mar, Kitara and Andrak go west toward the elven city of Lloreander while Kyle and Thorgast head north to the Barbarian city of Chul'hara.*END SPOILERS*The Pros:1a.) a definite improvement in the quality of  prose and story-telling by author Day over the first novel.1b.) hard to put a finger on, but there seemed to be a more palpable edginess to some the action scenes...a can't wait to turn the page to find out what happens sensation. I found this particularly true in some of the battles and during the cave treks.2.) better character development (even some of the bad guys). The author has spent some time bringing a sense of personality and perspective to many of his important characters.3.) spoiler...as with the first book, the unexpected demise of some important characters. BRAVO...nothing worse or more unbelievable in a fantasy adventure then having all your good guys sacrosanct.3.) a really good map. This is a story that appears to be expanding geographically. The map also has a distance scale so if you care (and I do) you can get a feel for the leagues between point A and point B on quests. This allows a reader to appreciate the time element (as well as the distance) spent traveling. This story, without a map, would be greatly diminished.4.) stunning cover art. I often wonder if authors (especially if the author is relatively unknown) realize how this can make or break a readers decision to buy a book or not...if it doesn't catch your eye right off...Concerns: (really only one)About a third of the way into this book, the story gets sidetracked with a prolonged historical description of the origins of good and evil factions and their ensuing conflicts that resulted in the Portal gates being placed on the world of Kil'Tar. Here's my peeve...while I like to know 'some' background material regarding important structures within a story, BUT not to be point of bringing the entire main story to a grinding halt. This type of info could be adequately revealed to the reader by brief dialogues between characters...rather than a show-stopping flashback.Conclusion:A very good second book...complete with all the normal trappings you'd expect in a well written fantasy tale...battles, magic, treks, interesting characters etc. This is a novel that gravitates to many diverse arrays of situational encounters...if you looking for lots of fantasy action  with some interesting narrative inbetween engagements, then this is a book you'll enjoy. Unfortunately it did have a small break in the mainstream tale as per my concern mentioned above...however still 5 Stars.Ray Nicholson|[ashar, an, rising, nexus, wars, saga, is, the, second, of, a, potential, 5, to, 7, book, fantasy, adventure, series, by, author, robert, day, this, kindle, e, edition, only, book, is, a, 718, kb, download, and, retails, for, 2, 99, general, theme, spoilers, no, specific, details, revealed, this, book, picks, up, were, the, first, ended, however, it, differs, from, book, one, in, that, it, follows, several, important, people, from, a, group, that, split, up, at, the, end, of, the, first, book, val, goes, south, towards, dak, mar, kitara, and, andrak, go, west, toward, the, elven, city, of, lloreander, while, kyle, and, thorgast, head, north, to, the, barbarian, city, of, chul, hara, end, spoilers, the, pros, 1a, a, definite, improvement, in, the, quality, of, prose, and, story, telling, by, author, day, over, the, first, novel, 1b, hard, to, put, a, finger, on, but, there, seemed, to, be, a, more, palpable, edginess, to, some, the, action, scenes, a, can, t, wait, to, turn, the, page, to, find, out, what, happens, sensation, i, found, this, particularly, true, in, some, of, the, battles, and, during, the, cave, treks, 2, better, character, development, even, some, of, the, bad, guys, the, author, has, spent, some, time, bringing, a, sense, of, personality, and, perspective, to, many, of, his, important, characters, 3, spoiler, as, with, the, first, book, the, unexpected, demise, of, some, important, characters, bravo, nothing, worse, or, more, unbelievable, in, a, fantasy, adventure, then, having, all, your, good, guys, sacrosanct, 3, a, really, good, map, this, is, a, story, that, appears, to, be, expanding, geographically, the, map, also, has, a, distance, scale, so, if, you, care, and, i, do, you, can, get, a, feel, for, the, leagues, between, point, a, and, point, b, on, quests, this, allows, a, reader, to, appreciate, the, time, element, as, well, as, the, distance, spent, traveling, this, story, without, a, map, would, be, greatly, diminished, 4, stunning, cover, art, i, often, wonder, if, authors, especially, if, the, author, is, relatively, unknown, realize, how, this, can, make, or, break, a, readers, decision, to, buy, a, book, or, not, if, it, doesn, t, catch, your, eye, right, off, concerns, really, only, one, about, a, third, of, the, way, into, this, book, the, story, gets, sidetracked, with, a, prolonged, historical, description, of, the, origins, of, good, and, evil, factions, and, their, ensuing, conflicts, that, resulted, in, the, portal, gates, being, placed, on, the, world, of, kil, tar, here, s, my, peeve, while, i, like, to, know, some, background, material, regarding, important, structures, within, a, story, but, not, to, be, point, of, bringing, the, entire, main, story, to, a, grinding, halt, this, type, of, info, could, be, adequately, revealed, to, the, reader, by, brief, dialogues, between, characters, rather, than, a, show, stopping, flashback, conclusion, a, very, good, second, book, complete, with, all, the, normal, trappings, you, d, expect, in, a, well, written, fantasy, tale, battles, magic, treks, interesting, characters, etc, this, is, a, novel, that, gravitates, to, many, diverse, arrays, of, situational, encounters, if, you, looking, for, lots, of, fantasy, action, with, some, interesting, narrative, inbetween, engagements, then, this, is, a, book, you, ll, enjoy, unfortunately, it, did, have, a, small, break, in, the, mainstream, tale, as, per, my, concern, mentioned, above, however, still, 5, stars, ray, nicholson]|542   |\n",
